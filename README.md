# Work-Day-Planner

## Description
This web app keeps track of your day-to-day work routine. The day is split into hours and the user is able to log events within individual boxes that correspond to the hour they clicked into. The hour boxes are also color coded based on whether it is the current hour, an hour in the past, or an hour in the future.

## Visual

## Usage
Intended Usage:

A user will select an hour to add text to by clicking that hour's box.

They will then click the save icon on the far right to save their input.

Upon a page refresh, the user will still be able to see their logged entries within the box they added it to.
